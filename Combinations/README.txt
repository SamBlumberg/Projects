In this project we had to write a program in 5 languages. The program takes two integers K and N
and prints all combinations of k numbers from 1,2,....n. 

The python implementation is ran with: python3 combinations.py K N. 
Prolog can be ran with: swipl Prolog.pl, followed by calls of combinations(k, n, L). followed by semi colons for all possible combinations. 
Ocaml can be ran with ocaml combinations.ml K N.
C# can be compiled with ./mcs csharp.cs and then ran with ./mono csharp.exe. 
Lastly Ada can be compiled with gnatmake combinations.adb and then ran with ./combinations K N.
